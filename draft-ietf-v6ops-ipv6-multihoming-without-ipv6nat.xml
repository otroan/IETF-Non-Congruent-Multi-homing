    <abstract>
      <t>Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) works well for
      conserving global addresses and addressing multihoming
      requirements, because an IPv4 NAPT router implements three
      functions: source address selection, next-hop resolution and
      optionally DNS resolution. For IPv6 hosts one approach could be
      the use of IPv6 NAT. However, NAT should be avoided, if at all
      possible, to permit transparent end-to-end connectivity. In this
      document, we analyze the use cases of multihoming. We also
      describe functional requirements and possible solutions for
      multihoming without the use of NAT in IPv6 for hosts and small
      IPv6 networks that would otherwise be unable to meet minimum IPv6
      allocation criteria. Nevertheless, we mention that the possible
      needs for IPv6 NAT in the transition phase to the fully deployment
      of the proposed solutions.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>IPv6 provides enough globally unique addresses to permit every
      conceivable host on the Internet to be uniquely addressed without
      the requirement for Network Address Port Translation (<xref
      target="RFC3022">NAPT</xref>), offering a renaissance in
      end-to-end transparent connectivity.</t>

      <t>Unfortunately, this may not be possible due to the necessity of
      NAT even in IPv6, because of multihoming.  Though there are some
      mechanisms to implement multihoming, such as <xref
      target="RFC4116"> BGP multihoming</xref> in network level, and
      <xref target="RFC4960">SCTP based multihoming</xref> in
      application transport level, there is no mechanism in IPv6 that
      serves as a replacement for NAT based multihoming in IPv4.  In
      IPv4, for a host or a small network, NAT based multihoming is
      easily deployable and an already deployed technique. Some of the
      same reasons for IPv4 NATs may be applicable to IPv6.</t>

      <t>Whenever a host or small network (which does not meet minimum IPv6
      allocation criteria) is connected to multiple upstream networks, an IPv6
      address is assigned by each respective service provider resulting in
      hosts with multiple global scope IPv6 addresses with different prefixes.
      As each service provider is allocated a different address space from 
      its Internet Registry, it in-turn assigns a different address space 
      to the end-user network or host.  For example, a remote access user's 
      host or router may use a VPN to simultaneously connect to a remote network
      and retain a default route to the Internet for other purposes.</t>

      <t>In IPv4 a common solution to the multihoming problem is to
      employ NAPT on a border router and use private address space for
      individual host addressing. The use of NAPT allows hosts to have
      exactly one IP address visible on the public network and the
      combination of NAPT with provider-specific outside addresses
      (one for each uplink) and destination-based routing insulates a
      host from the impacts of multiple upstream networks. The border
      router may also implement a DNS cache or DNS policy to resolve
      address queries from hosts.</t>

      <t>It is our goal to avoid the IPv6 equivalent of NAT. So, the
      goals for IPv6 multihoming defined in <xref target="RFC3582">
      </xref> do not match the goals of this document. Also regardless of 
      what the IPv6 NAT's specification is, we are trying to avoid 
      any form of network address translation technique that may not
      be visible for either of the end hosts. To reach this goal, 
      mechanisms are needed for end-user hosts to have
      multiple address assignments and resolve issues such as which
      address to use for sourcing traffic to which destination:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols"> <t>If multiple routers exist on a single
      link the host must select the appropriate next-hop for each
      connected network. Each router is in turn connected to a different
      service provider network, which provides independent address
      assignment. Routing protocols that would normally be employed for
      router-to-router network advertisement seem inappropriate for use
      by individual hosts.</t>

      <t>Source address selection also becomes difficult whenever a host
      has more than one address within the same address scope.  Current
      address selection criteria may result in hosts using an arbitrary or
      random address when sourcing upstream traffic.  Unfortunately, for
      the host, the appropriate source address is a function of the
      upstream network for which the packet is bound for.  If an upstream
      service provider uses IP anti-spoofing or ingress filtering, it is
      conceivable that the packets that have an inappropriate source address
      for the upstream network would never reach their destination.</t>

      <t>In a multihomed environment, different DNS scopes or partitions
      may exist in each independent upstream network.  A DNS query sent
      to an arbitrary upstream DNS recursive name servier may result in
      incorrect or poisoned responses.</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>In short, while IPv6 facilitates hosts having more than one 
      address in the same address scope, the application of this causes 
      significant issues for a host from routing, source address selection
      and DNS resolution perspectives.  A possible consequence of assigning 
      a host multiple identically-scoped addresses is severely impaired IP
      connectivity.</t>

      <t>If a host connects to a network behind an IPv4 NAPT, the host has 
      one private address in the local network.  There is no confusion.  
      The NAT becomes the gateway of the host and forwards the packet to an
      appropriate network when it is multihomed.  It also operates a DNS
      cache server, which receives all DNS inquires, and gives a correct
      answer to the host.</t>

      <t>In this document, we analyze the use cases of multihoming. We
      also describe functional requirements and possible solutions for
      multihoming without the use of NAT in IPv6 for hosts and small
      IPv6 networks that would otherwise be unable to meet minimum IPv6
      allocation criteria. Nevertheless, we mention that the possible
      needs for IPv6 NAT in the transition phase to the fully deployment
      of the proposed solutions.</t>

      <section anchor="classification" title="Classification of network scenarios for multihomed host">
        <t>Scenario 1:</t>

        <t>In this scenario, two or more routers are present on a single
        link shared with the host(s). Each router is in turn connected
        to a different service provider network, which provides
        independent address assignment and DNS recursive name servers. A

        <t>Scenario 2:</t>

        <t>In this scenario, a single gateway router connects the host
        to two or more upstream service provider networks. This gateway
        router would receive prefix delegations and a different set of
        DNS recursive name servers from each independent service
        provider network. The gateway in turn advertises the provider
        prefixes to the host, and for DNS, may either act as a
        lightweight DNS cache server or may advertise the complete set
        of service provider DNS recursive name servers to the hosts.</t>

        <t>In an IPv6 multihomed network, a host is assigned two or more
        IPv6 addresses and DNS recursive name servers from independent
        service provider networks. When this multihomed host attempts to
        connect with other hosts, it may incorrectly resolve the
        next-hop router, use an inappropriate source address, or use a

        <t>Multihomed networks in IPv4 have been commonly implemented
        through the use of a gateway router with NAPT function
        (scenario 2 with NAPT). An analysis of the current IPv4 NAPT
        and DNS functions within the gateway router should provide a
        baseline set of requirements for IPv6 multihomed
        environments. A destination prefix/route is often used on the

      <section title="Problem Statement">
        <t>A multihomed IPv6 host has one or more assigned IPv6
        addresses and DNS recursive name servers from each upstream
        service provider, resulting in the host having multiple valid
        IPv6 addresses and DNS recursive name servers.  The host must be
        able to resolve the appropriate next-hop, the correct source
        address and DNS recursive name server to use based on the
        destination prefix. To prevent IP spoofing, operators will often
        implement ingress filtering to discard traffic with an
        inappropriate source address, making it essential for the host
        to correctly resolve these three items before sourcing the
        first packet.</t>

        <t>IPv6 has mechanisms for the provision of multiple routers
        on a single link and multiple address assignments to a single
        host. However, when these mechanisms are applied to the three 
        scenarios in <xref target="classification"></xref> a number of 
        connectivity issues are identified:</t>

        <t>Scenario 1:</t>

        <t>The host has been assigned an address from each router and
        recognizes both rtr1 and rtr2 as valid default routers (in the
        default routers list).</t>

	<t><list style="symbols">
	  <t>The source address selection policy on the host does not
	  deterministically resolve a source address. Ingress filtering
	  or filter policies will discard traffic with source addresses
	  that the operator did not assign.</t>

	  <t>The host will select one of the two routers as the active
	  default router. No traffic is sent to the other router.</t>

	</list></t>

        <t>Scenario 2:</t>

        <t>The host has been assigned two different addresses from the single
        gateway router. The gateway router is the only default router on the
        link.</t>

	<t><list style="symbols">
	  <t>The source address selection policy on the host does not
	  deterministically resolve a source address. Ingress filtering 
	  or filter policies will discard traffic with source addresses

      </list></t>

      <t>This section reviews the problem statements presented above 
      and the proposed functional requirements to resolve the issues.
      </t>

      <section title="Source address selection"> <t>A multihomed IPv6
      host will typically have different addresses assigned from each
      service provider either on the same link (scenarios 1 &amp; 2) or
      different links (scenario 3). When the host wishes to send a
      packet to any given destination, the current source address
      selection rules <xref target="RFC3484"></xref> may not
      deterministically resolve the correct source address when the host
      addressing was via Router Advertisement (RA) or DHCPv6. <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-6man-addr-select-considerations"></xref>
      describes the use of the policy table <xref
      target="RFC3484"></xref> to resolve this problem, but there is no
      mechanism defined to disseminate the policy table information to a
      host. A proposal is in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-6man-addr-select-opt"></xref> to provide a DHCPv6
      mechanism for host policy table management.</t>

        <t>Again, by employing DHCPv6, the server could restrict address
        assignment (of additional prefixes) only to hosts that support
        policy table management.</t>

        <t>Scenario 1: "Host" needs to support the solution for this
        problem.</t>

        <t>Scenario 2: "Host" needs to support the solution for this
        problem.</t>

        <t>Scenario 3: If "Host" support the next-hop selection
        solution, there is no need to support the address selection
        functionality on the host.</t>
        
        <t>It is noted that the service providers (i.e., ISP and
        enterprise/VPN) must also support <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-6man-addr-select-opt"></xref>.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Next-hop selection">
        <t>A multihomed IPv6 host or gateway may have multiple uplinks
        to different service providers. Here each router would use
        Router Advertisements <xref target="RFC4861"></xref> for
        distributing default route/next-hop information to the host or
        gateway router.</t>

        <t>In this case, the host or gateway router may select any
        valid default router from the default routers list, resulting
        in traffic being sent to the wrong router and discarded by the
        upstream service provider. Using the above scenarios as an
        example, whenever the host wishes to reach a destination in
        network 2 and there is no connectivity between networks 1 and
        2 (as is the case for a walled-garden or closed
        service), the host or gateway router does not know whether to
        forward traffic to rtr1 or rtr2 to reach a destination in
        network 2. The host or gateway router may choose rtr1 as the
        default router, and traffic fails to reach the destination
        server.  The host or gateway router requires route information
        for each upstream service provider, but the use of a routing
        protocol between the gateway and the two routers causes both
        configuration and scaling issues. For IPv4 hosts, the gateway
        router is often pre-configured with static route information or
        uses of Classless Static Route Options <xref
        target="RFC3442"></xref> for DHCPv4. Extensions to Router
        Advertisements through Default Router Preference and
        More-Specific Routes <xref target="RFC4191"></xref> provides for
        link-specific preferences but does not address per-host
        configuration in a multi-access topology because of its reliance
        on Router Advertisements. A DHCPv6 option, such as that in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mif-dhcpv6-route-option"></xref>, is preferred
        for host-specific configuration. By employing a DHCPv6 solution,
        a DHCPv6 server could restrict address assignment (of additional
        prefixes) only to hosts that support more advanced next-hop and
        address selection requirements.</t>

      <section title="DNS recursive name server selection">
        <t>A multihomed IPv6 host or gateway router may be provided
        multiple DNS recursive name servers through <xref
        target="RFC3646">DHCPv6</xref> or <xref target="RFC6106">
        RA</xref>. When the host or gateway router sends a DNS query, it would
        normally choose one of the available DNS recursive name servers
        for the query.</t>

        <t>In the IPv6 gateway router scenario, the Broadband Forum
        <xref target="TR124"></xref> required that the query be sent to
        all DNS recursive name servers, and the gateway waits for the
        first reply. In IPv6, given our use of specific
        destination-based policy for both routing and source address
        selection, it is desirable to extend a policy-based concept to
        DNS recursive name server selection. Doing so can minimize DNS
        recursive name server load and avoid issues where DNS recursive
        name servers in different networks have connectivity issues, or
        the DNS recursive name server are not publicly accessible. In
        the worst case, a DNS query for a name from a local namespace
        may not be resolved correctly if sent towards a DNS server not
        aware of said local namespace, resulting in a lack of
        connectivity.</t>

        <t>It is not issue of Domain Name System model itself, but an
        IPv6 multihomed host or gateway router should have the ability
        to select appropriate DNS recursive name servers for each
        service based on the domain space for the destination, and each
        service should provide rules specific to that network. <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mif-dns-server-selection"></xref> proposes a

    <section anchor="implementation" title="Implementation approach">
      <t>As mentioned in <xref target="analysis"></xref>, in the
      multi-prefix environment, we have three problems in source address
      selection, next-hop selection, and DNS recursive name server
      selection. In this section, possible solution mechanisms for each
      problem are introduced and evaluated against the requirements in
      <xref target="requirements"></xref>.</t>

      <section title="Source address selection">

	<t>Possible solutions and their evaluation are summarized in
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-addr-select-considerations"></xref>. When
	those solutions are examined against the requirements in <xref
	target="requirements"></xref>, the proactive approaches, such
	as the policy table distribution mechanism and the routing
	hints mechanism, are more appropriate in that
	they can propagate the network administrator's policy
	directly. The policy distribution mechanism has an advantage
	with regard to the host's protocol stack impact and the
	static nature of the assumed target network environment.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Next-hop selection">

	<t>As for the source address selection problem, both a
	policy-based approach and a non policy-based approach are
	possible with regard to the next-hop selection problem. Because
	of the same requirements, the policy propagation-based solution
	mechanism, whatever the policy, should be more
	appropriate.</t>

	<t>Routing information is a typical example of policy related
	to next-hop selection. If we assume source address-based routing
	at hosts or intermediate routers, the pairs of source prefixes
	and next-hops can be another example of next-hop selection
	policy.</t>

	<t>The routing information-based approach has a clear
	advantage in implementation and is already commonly used. </t>

	<t>The existing proposed or standardized routing information
	distribution mechanisms are routing protocols, such as RIPng and
	OSPFv3, the RA extension option defined in <xref
	target="RFC4191"></xref>, the DHCPv6 route information option
	proposed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mif-dhcpv6-route-option"></xref>,
	and the <xref target="TR069"></xref> standardized at BBF.</t>

	<t>The RA-based mechanism has difficulty in per-host routing
	information distribution. The dynamic routing protocols such as
	RIPng are not usually used between the residential users and
	ISP networks because of their scalability implications. The DHCPv6
	mechanism does not have these difficulties and has the
	advantage of its relaying functionality. It is commonly
	used and is thus easy to deploy.</t>

	<t><xref target="TR069"></xref>, mentioned above, is a possible
	solution mechanism for routing information distribution to
	customer-premises equipment (CPE).
	It assumes, however, IP reachability to the Auto
	Configuration Server (ACS) is established.  Therefore, if the CPE
	requires routing information to reach the ACS, <xref
	target="TR069"></xref> cannot be used to distribute this
	information.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="DNS recursive name server selection">

	<t>As in the above two problems, a policy-based approach and non 
	policy-based approach are possible.  In a non policy-based approach, 
	a host or a home gateway router is assumed to send DNS queries to 
	several DNS recursive name servers at once or to select one of the available 
	servers.</t>

	<t>In the non policy-based approach, by making a query to a DNS
	recursive name server in a different service provider to that which
	hosts the service, a user could be directed to unexpected IP address
	or receive an invalid response, and thus cannot connect to the
	service provider's private and legitimate service.  For example,
	some DNS recursive name servers reply with different answers
	depending on the source address of the DNS query, which is sometimes
	called split-horizon. When the host mistakenly makes a query to a
	different provider's DNS recursive name server to resolve a FQDN of
	another provider's private service, and the DNS recursive name
	server adopts the split-horizon configuration, the queried server
	returns an IP address of the non-private side of the service. 
	Another problem with this approach is that it causes unnecessary DNS
	traffic to the DNS recursive name servers that are visible to the
	users.</t>

	<t>The alternative of a policy-based approach is documented in <xref
	target="I-D.ietf-mif-dns-server-selection"></xref>, where several
	pairs of DNS recursive name server addresses and DNS domain suffixes
	are defined as part of a policy and conveyed to hosts in a new DHCP
	option. In an environment where there is a home gateway router, that
	router can act as a DNS recursive name server, interpret this option
	and distribute DNS queries to the appropriate DNS servers according
	to the policy.</t>

      <section title="IPv6 NAT">

	<t>In a typical IPv4 multihomed network deployment, IPv4 NAPT
	is practically used and it can eventually avoid assigning
	multiple addresses to the hosts and solve the next-hop

      <t>To allow the co-existence of non-MHMP hosts and MHMP hosts

      <t>An idea to achieve this is that GW-rtr identifies the hosts,
      and then assigns a single prefix to non-MHMP hosts and assigns

      <t>Another idea is that GW-rtr assigns multiple prefixes to the

  <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">

	<t>This document requires that the solutions for MHMP should have
	policy providing functions.  New security threats can be introduced
	depending on what kind and what form of the policy.  The threats can
	be categorized in two parts: the policy receiver side and the policy
	distributor side.</t>
	
	<t>A policy receiver may receive an evil policy from a policy
	distributor. A policy distributor should expect some hosts in its
	network do not follow the distributed policy. The security threats
	related to IPv6 multihoming are described in <xref
	target="RFC4218"></xref>. Those threats that are specific to MHMP
	solutions are enumerated below.</t>
	
	<t>
		<list style="hanging">
			<t hangText="Threats related to the policy distributor side:">
				<list>
					<t>Policy collision can happen. When multiple policy
					distributor exists, a policy receiver may not follow
					one or each of the received policy. Especially when
					a policy conflicts with another policy, a policy
					receiver cannot implement each of the policy. To
					solve or mitigate this issue, policy prioritization
					rule should be defined, such as preference for the
					policy received on a trusted interface. Another
					solution is to preclude the functionality of
					multiple policy acceptance at the receiver side. In
					this case, a policy distributor should cooperate
					with other policy distributors, and a single
					representative provider should distribute a merged
					policy.</t>

					<t>Apart from the policy collision, a network
					service provider should expect the existence of
					hosts that will not obey the received policy. A
					possible solutions is to ingress-filter those
					packets that do not match the distributed policy and
					drop them. About the route selection, packet
					forwarding or redirection can be another possible
					solution. About the source address selection, IPv6
					NAT can be another possible solution.</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			
			<t hangText="Threats related to the policy receiver side:">
				<list>
					<t>A policy receiver are exposed to the threats of
					unauthorized policy, which can lead to session
					hijack, DoS, wiretapping and phishing. Unauthorized
					policy here means a policy distributed from an
					entity that does not have rights to do so. Usually,
					only a site administrator and a network service
					provider have rights to distribute these policies
					just as well as IP address assignment and DNS server
					address notification. Regarding source address
					selection, unauthorized policy can expose an IP
					address that will not usually be exposed to an
					external server, which can be a privacy problem. To
					solve or mitigate this problem of unauthorized
					policy, one approach is limiting on use of these
					policy distribution mechanisms, as described in the
					section 4.4 of <xref
					target="I-D.ietf-mif-dns-server-selection"></xref>.
					For example, a policy should be preferred or
					accepted when the policy is delivered across a
					secure, trusted channel such as 3G connection in
					cellular services. The proposed solutions are baed
					on DHCP, so the limitation of local site
					communication, which is often used in WiFi access
					services, should be another solution or mitigation
					for this problem. About DNS server selection issue,
					DNSSEC can be another solution. About source address
					selection, the ingress filter at the
					network	service provider router can be a
					solution.</t>

					<t>Another threat is the leakage of the policy and
					privacy issues resulting from that. Especially when
					each client is distributed its own policy from the
					network service provider, the policy can give a hint
					of which service the client subscribes. Encryption
					of communication channel, separation of
					communication channel per host can be solutions for
					this problem.</t>

	<!--

	<t>The security considerations of MHMP are brief, simply noting that
	a policy might be "evil" or the participants might ignore the
	policy. I think it is more complicated.</t>

	<t>There is a fundamental question of who should be trusted to
	distribute policy. How is the trust established, and how can the
	network element be assured that it can established that trust before
	the network is fully configured.  This might be quite difficult,
	because there could be more than one policy distributor, each with a
	slightly different view of the network. It seems inevitable that a
	host will have to be able to merge policies and deal with
	updates.</t>

	<t>Discussion: Shouldn't the device policy be out of scope? 'Further, a
	host might have its own policies to merge into the mix. For example,
	it might require a DNSSEC capable server for queries about network
	A, but the policy might specify a non-DNSSEC server for that
	network.  Thus, I can see a need for hosts to communicate their
	security requirements to the policy server.'</t>

	<t>Discussion: Shouldn't it be out of scope? 'There are issues about
	the privacy of the policy itself.  Perhaps particular network
	prefixes reveal business relationships that are confidential. Thus,
	some policy information might be sent on encrypted channels.'</t>

	<t>Discussion: Shoundn't it need define behavior? 'What kind of
	policy enforcement is necessary?  If a host violates the multihoming
	policy and sends a packet with a source address that is appropriate
	to a network over the path to another network, should the packet be
	blocked, redirected, or allowed?  What about DNS queries that are
	sent to a server that is not recommended for the target? Quash,
	redirect, or allow?  What information should go back to the
	host?'</t>

	<t>I think that most of these comments apply to any policy server,
	and I believe that various IETF documents in the past have attempted
